# Network-Topology
The purpose of this project was to practice creating a Network topology and some shell scripting. This project was based on my Lab from my CSE 150 course at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

## Files: 
- Christy-topo.py: This file is the python script that creates the topology of a network with 4 hosts connected to 1 switch.
- Christy Jose-script.sh: This file is the python script for the prelab that prints out all of the even numbered lines in each file in the current directory. The output has the filename followed by a colon and whatever is on that line.
- Christy Jose-lab1.pdf: This file contains the solutions to all of the question for the prelab, and all of the screenshots and answers to the lab.
